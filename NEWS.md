## Features

This package provides the tools necessary to compute the empirical Allan Variance (AV) and use it to estimate the parameters of (latent) time series models. The estimation of the AV is performed through the estimator proposed by Allan (1966) and, based on this quantity, the Allan Variance Linear Regression (AVLR) approach is often used by engineers to retrieve the parameters of time series models which are assumed to underlie the observed signals (see for example Guerrier, Molinari, and Stebler 2016). These estimators are implemented in this package along with the relevant plotting and summary functions.
